## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installing

1. Clone the repo.

2. Install node packages. 

```
npm install
```

3. Clone the [server-side websocket app](https://github.com/emcooper/coin-cluster)

4. Install node packages on the websocket app. 

```
npm install
```

5. In the client app, change websocket endpoint to local host.

src/App.js line:8 
```
-const endpoint = "https://coin-cluster-backend.herokuapp.com/"
+const endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

6. Start the websocket server
```
npm start
```

7. Start the client server
```
npm start
```

The client application should open in your browser automatically.


## Deployment

### To deploy the server-side app:
```
heroku create app-name
git push heroku master
```

Change the client side endpoint to the heroku url.

src/App.js line:8 
```
-const endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
+const endpoint = "https://app-name.herokuapp.com/"

```

### To deploy the react client:

#### Step 1: Replace `homepage` in `package.json`

Open your `package.json` and replace the `homepage` field with your own github repo address:

```js
  "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",
```

#### Step 2: Deploy the site by running `npm run deploy`

Then run:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

#### Step 3: Ensure your projectâ€™s settings use `gh-pages`

Finally, make sure **GitHub Pages** option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the `gh-pages` branch:
